# Town-Planning-for-Severe-Convective-Storm-Risk
Coursework 1 26GYP046

Author: Johann Posanski

This little project is part of a coursework for Loughborough University. The Setup and workings of the core SCS skript are adapted from a R skript that was originially developed by John Hillier (J.Hillier@lboro.ac.uk). The map template as well as the property setup files are also from him.

# Shortomings
The code is readiliy expandable to allow for arbitrary settlement structures. However file and title names are only adaptive to the 6 configurations in the current state. Expanding to higher generality would require extra work.
The risk model is easily expandable to include differnt vulnurability or hazard functions.


# AI declaration
The Visual Studio Code Copilot (mostly Claude 4.5) was used in this project. The strucure and logical core is self developed. AI was used for bugfixing as well as an assistent for more tedious coding bits (e.g. "write up this juypiter notebook code block into a function" or "please make this plot title adaptive to the current setup"). Furthermore AI was used as a google equivalent (e.g. "please explain to me how i can manually adjust the position of the legend in a matplotlib.pyplot figure").
